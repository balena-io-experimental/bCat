# balenaCloud Automated Testing (bCat)

> Test and finalize releases automatically on balenaCloud with bCat :lightning:

Imagine a world:

1. Where you can test your app directly on the devices in the field
2. Where you can deploy releases without worrying that it will break your fleet
3. Where you can spend time focusing on writing new features and improving your app instead of checking releases

bCat is the solution to all that. It's our automated testing process that makes it easy to test your app on balenaCloud directly on the hardware you work with. 
With bCat, we intend our users to be closer to our own `deploy equals merge` strategy. Our prime focus being able to make testing frictionless for IoT applications.
